            <h3><a href="www.gppgle.com">SIGN LANGUAGE DETECTION</a></h3>
            <p>One of the non-verbal communication techniques utilised in sign language is the hand gesture. It is mostly used by deaf and dumb individuals to communicate with other people or among themselves when they have hearing or speech issues. Many makers around the world have created various sign language systems, but they are neither adaptable nor cost-effective for end users. So, inorder to enable deaf and dumb people communicate with normal people and each other more efficiently, software that can automatically detect sign language is presented in this work as a system prototype. The two emerging topics of study are pattern recognition and gesture recognition. Hand gestures play a crucial role in nonverbal communication and are essential to daily living.<a href="https://github.com/Poludasarishashikumar/SignLanguage_Detection_Project">Full Project Details</a></br></br></br>
